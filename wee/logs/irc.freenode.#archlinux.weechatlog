2017-12-24 22:36:22	not_a_nickname	occultus: Ah rip.  I read that mariadb was recommended for it, as it had extra capabilities or improved performance or something, and I was familiar with the name so I just assumed it'd probably have the most support.  I guess at this point I should go through with it right?  I'm using the AUR packages for php version 7.0 instead of nextcloud-git,

2017-12-24 23:09:24	Aardwolf	Hi, I tried to install archlinux on a new computer, but after booting with grub it says "ACPI error", "namespace lookup failure", "AE_NOT_FOUND". Also, I would expect it to ask for a password since I used full disk encryption with luks for root (but not for boot). What could be wrong?
2017-12-24 23:09:42	MrElendig	Aardwolf: forgot the hooks?
2017-12-24 23:10:45	Aardwolf	I added "cryptdevice=......" (as in the wiki under Dm-Crypt" to the grub config, and, I added "encrypt" to mkinitcpio.conf (which would have no effect I think, how can it read that file if it never asked for a password). Anything else I'm missing?

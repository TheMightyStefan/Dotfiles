2017-12-24 22:04:04	mr_yogurt	Delver: can you elaborate?
2017-12-24 22:04:32	mr_yogurt	also i probably should've said thumbsticks rather than joysticks but whatever
2017-12-24 22:05:25	Delver	well in most cases the gimbals on a joystick or several inches away from the center of your hand. this requires your hand to make a rotational movement as well as a sideward translation to move it to the side
2017-12-24 22:05:51	Delver	where you really should have the pitch/yaw axis closer to the center of your hand
2017-12-24 22:06:06	+m[at]	are we discussing masturbation physics?
2017-12-24 22:06:28	Delver	3d joysticks at least have a twist axis through the center. but it doesn't synch with the pitch and roll axis so it feels all wrong.
2017-12-24 22:06:37	Delver	this is why the pedals feel more natural

2017-12-24 22:12:23	Delver	well the mice are meant for cad operations. howver the one that looks like it's in a 3d gibal offers all the translation axis. I'd like a game version of that
2017-12-24 22:12:57	Delver	it mimics to some degree the teleoperator systems for radioactive hot boxes. IF I can find the image

2017-12-24 22:16:57	Delver	probably the first 3d controller for any videogame
2017-12-24 22:17:30	Delver	it had 4 translations, plus twist. it was only missing roll

2017-12-24 22:36:07	mr_yogurt	i think we're talking past each other
2017-12-24 22:36:30	Delver	the thing is, many people can barely use one input. two if you include the pedals. most of the time, I can only use my right hand (with fine motor control) for the stick. where I would use my left hand (with gross control skill) for mashing buttons. I can't use my left hand for fine control because I'm right handed. I could use my feet but then I'd need yet another controler. and of course, I have to put my feet in a particular spot and I'd have to 
2017-12-24 22:36:30	Delver	set up and a certain angle
2017-12-24 22:36:30	mr_yogurt	are you saying that if we fake a joystick with the space mouse we'll lose some of our 6dof and it'll be 3dof or something
2017-12-24 22:37:03	Delver	no. I'm saying we GAIN control because all degrees of movement are now under the hand that has fine control skills
2017-12-24 22:37:56	Delver	his hand is also doing all of this with minimal motion
2017-12-24 22:38:18	mr_yogurt	Delver: i suppose implementing it doesn't mean much since someone's already done it from the looks of things
2017-12-24 22:38:31	Delver	large motions are bad because it involves the elbow and shoulder which tire easily and also lack fine control

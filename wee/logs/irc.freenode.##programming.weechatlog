2017-12-02 15:27:47	rosa	does clone() ALWAYS return the pid of the new cloned process?
2017-12-02 15:29:38	GhostwalkGames	Since PID is an unique identifier for a process, there's no way to have two distinct process with the same PID.

2017-12-02 15:48:48	decl	Amun_Ra: but you can't goto the cleanup code in another function. I don't see a way around duplicating the cleanup code with one copy inside the initialization function (that gets jumped into with the goto in case of error) and another copy in the release function for normal cleanup when the object is no longer needed.
2017-12-02 15:49:00	rosa	eg the same register can hold different value types depending on the syscall, eg int (for write(int, char, int); ) or char (for open(char, int); )
2017-12-02 15:49:24	Amun_Ra	decl: I thought you mean dealing with multiple allocations etc in one function
2017-12-02 15:49:27	rosa	and hence would need to be read different
2017-12-02 15:50:18	decl	Amun_Ra: yeah, pretty much that. That function is the "constructor" of an object and the cleanup code already exists in the "destructor" function.

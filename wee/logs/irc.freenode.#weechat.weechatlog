2017-12-02 15:31:33	@nils_2	the number of unread messages will be displayed with hotlist, for example
2017-12-02 15:31:47	Voldenet	jokes aside, I wonder if there's a built-in variable with that
2017-12-02 15:32:13	@nils_2	or you can use buflist plugin or buffers.pl. sure, its hotlist

2017-12-02 15:34:59	Voldenet	it's a bit of a failed experiment now though, could use major refactoring :P
2017-12-02 15:35:05	@nils_2	yes, for example with a script
2017-12-02 15:36:41	Voldenet	it basically exports "${buffer.local_variables.msgcount}${buffer.local_variables.actanim}" to use in buflist.format.number for example

2017-12-02 15:48:10	Voldenet	huh, didn't know that
2017-12-02 15:48:40	the_fine_man	So, how exactly should I create that script ?
2017-12-02 15:49:45	the_fine_man	I need a trigger of a received private message to create some sort of notification system
2017-12-02 15:49:45	@nils_2	use infolist("hotlist") to get buffers with new messages
2017-12-02 15:50:59	@nils_2	Voldenet: use ${eval:${format_hotlist}} in buflist.format.number
2017-12-02 15:54:46	the_fine_man	Ok, but how do I write that information into a file or something like that ?
2017-12-02 15:55:20	the_fine_man	The idea is that I need to take that information from weechat and use it elsewhere
2017-12-02 15:55:34	Voldenet	hmmm, but that'd require to make format_hotlist work, I feel more comfortable writing set of rules whether the message should be counted or not in perl ;)
2017-12-02 15:55:35	@nils_2	thats the job of your script :-)

2017-12-02 16:01:46	grawity	make your terminal emulator set the 'urgent' bit when an app beeps
2017-12-02 16:01:59	grawity	finally make i3 highlight workspaces which have 'urgent' windows
2017-12-02 16:02:15	the_fine_man	Oh, ok. I'll try that.

2017-12-02 16:03:11	grawity	just need to make weechat do the beepy thing via /trigger

2017-12-02 16:04:53	the_fine_man	There seems to be a script 'beep.pl'
